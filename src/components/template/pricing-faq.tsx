    q: "Is the free tier really enough to ship?",
    a: "Yes. Everything on this site — every animation, page and section — is the free tier. If your product needs one great landing site, you never have to pay us anything.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use Velora in commercial or client projects?",
    a: "Yes. The free tier is MIT licensed — use it in client work, products you sell, and internal tools. No attribution required.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Pro a subscription?",
    a: "No. Pro is a one-time payment with lifetime access and lifetime updates. No renewals, no seat counting for small teams.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in the Pro team license?",
    a: "Pro includes a team license, so everyone at your company can use the files. There are no per-seat fees for small teams.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I start on Free and upgrade later?",
    a: "Yes. Free stays free forever — nothing you ship on it is taken away. When Pro launches, waitlist members get launch pricing and early access.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does this compare to Magic UI Pro or Aceternity Pro?",
    a: "Those run $169–$199 for templates and sections. Velora gives away a complete multi-page template for free and prices Pro at $99 — with a team license included instead of sold separately.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when Pro launches?",
    a: "Waitlist members get launch pricing and early access. The free tier stays free forever — Pro only ever adds breadth on top.",
